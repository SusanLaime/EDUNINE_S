                                <p class="lh-sm">This conference serves as a central hub for researchers and educators to share cutting-edge research and best practices in <b>Engineering, Technology, and Computing (ETC) Education</b>. We encourage diverse submissions that explore the field through interdisciplinary and theoretical lenses.</p>
                                <h6 class="fw-bold">Thematic Relevance:</h6>
                                <p class="lh-sm">Papers should address the conference topics, including innovations, trends, challenges, and solutions in relevant fields that encompasses the IEEE Education Society’s field of interest which are the theory and practice of education and educational technology related to the effective delivery of knowledge in disciplines that fall within IEEE’s scope, such as engineering, computing, and technology-related fields. <i>Source</i>: <span class="text-end"><a href="https://ieee-edusociety.org/about/society-overview#mission" class="border-white btn btn-primary btn-sm" role="button">IEEE Education Society's Field of Interest</a> </span></p>

                                <p>While interdisciplinary and closely related topics may be a wonderful addition to a conference for publication in IEEE Xplore®, the papers themselves should be in an IEEE field of interest. Challenges arise when non-IEEE fields of interest are included.                      
                                <h6 class="fw-bold">Responding to a Dynamic Landscape: </h6> 
                                <span id="dots">...</span><div id="more">
                                    <p class="lh-sm">This conference acknowledges the rapid evolution of ETC education, particularly at the undergraduate level. We welcome discussions on emerging responsibilities in the field, such as: </p><p class="lh-sm"><ul><li>
                                            Expanding ETC education to K-12 and continuing education programs.</li><li>
                                            Promoting student body diversification to reflect population demographics.</li><li>
                                            Integrating the history and societal impact of technology into curriculum.</li><li>
                                            Cultivating technological literacy for non-engineering audiences.</li>   
                                    </ul>  
                                    <h6 class="fw-bold"> Interdisciplinary Focus:</h6>                           
                                    <p class="lh-sm">While the core focus is on ETC education, submissions from related fields are welcome. This includes education in other engineering branches, physical sciences, life sciences, or applied mathematics, as long as they demonstrate significant relevance to ETC education. </p> 

                                    <h6 class="fw-bold"> Emphasis on Pedagogy:</h6>                          
                                    <p class="lh-sm">Submissions involving digital technology should primarily focus on its pedagogical application and broader educational implications. Papers on software/hardware implementation should prioritize the educational context and learning outcomes, not just technical details. Detailed implementation architecture is best suited for online resources (URLs) and not the paper itself. </p>

                                    <h6 class="fw-bold"> Scope Considerations:</h6>                         
                                    <p class="lh-sm">Papers on non-technical subjects like tourism, philosophy, art, etc., typically fall outside the conference scope.</p></div>

                        <p class="lh-sm">This guide offers options for both individual paper creation and collaborative writing using the template.</p>

                        <h4 class="fw-bold">Two Effective Methods for Utilizing the Template:</h4>

                        <h5 class="fw-bold">A) Developing an Individual IEEE Conference Paper:</h5>
                        <p class="lh-sm">For individual paper creation, users can save a copy of the template as a new .docx file. This enables them to replace the template text with their own content while preserving the styles using "Paste and Match Formatting." Additionally, the Styles Panel in Microsoft Word displays the predefined template styles necessary for incorporating subtitles, lists, figures, tables, equations, and other elements required for writing the paper's content in various sections. <b><u>Please ensure that all guidance text is removed from your conference paper prior to submission to the conference. Failure to remove template text from your paper may result in your paper not being published.</u></b></p>

                        <h5 class="fw-bold">B) Creating a Microsoft Template (.dotx):</h5> 
                        <p class="lh-sm">The recommended approach for collaborative writing is to create a template file (.dotx). This ensures that all collaborators have access to the predefined styles and formats, promoting consistency and compliance with IEEE Xplore requirements.</p> 
                        <p class="lh-sm fw-bold">How to create a Microsoft Template (.dotx):</p><ol><li>

                                Launch Microsoft Word and open the conference-template-a4.docx file to create a template with the formats and styles for formatting your paper.</li>
